          <v-expansion-panel-content>
            The Randomizer League is a new game mode for the Ori and the Will of the Wisps Randomizer which allows
            multiple players to compete against each other asynchronously. All players play the same seeds but don't
            have to do so at the same time. Instead, each player can complete each game in a given time frame.

          <v-expansion-panel-content>
            Each season is a set of games which player can compete in. Every season has its own leaderboard and games of
            a season are counted towards the player's ranking on the leaderboard of that season. There can be multiple
            seasons in parallel. This allows for different seasons with unique seed settings, for example different
            difficulty levels.

          <v-expansion-panel-content>
            To play games in the Randomizer League, you need to first pick an upcoming season and join it. Joining
            seasons is possible until the first game of that season is finished. While it is possible to play without
            being a member in the

            >, it is heavily advised to be part of it to receive pings and reminders for your joined seasons as well as
            being added to spoiler discussion channels after you finished a game.<br />
            Once the season started, games will be created automatically in fixed intervals. You can then play these
            games whenever you want until they expire and the next game is created or the season is over.<br />
            You can also play training seeds to practice or try out the settings of a season.

            How are points calculated?
          </v-expansion-panel-header>
          <v-expansion-panel-content>
            After a game is finished, players who submitted a run are awarded two types of points:

            <ul class="mb-2">
              <li>
                <span class="font-italic">Base Points</span><br />
                Base Points are awarded to all players who submitted a run, regardless of their time.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="font-italic">Speed Points</span><br />
                Speed Points are awarded to players depending on their run time in relation to the fastest player.
              </li>
            </ul>

            The fastest time gets full Speed Points, fastest time * Speed Factor gets no Speed Points.
            Times that are in between these two will get points based on where in the range the final
            time was. The distribution of points is not necessarily linear.

          <v-expansion-panel-header class="font-weight-bold title"> How do I submit a run? </v-expansion-panel-header>
          <v-expansion-panel-content>
            The Randomizer League is deeply integrated into the Randomizer itself. Submission and basic validation of
            games is done automatically. If you want to submit a video recording of your run alongside the submitted
            time, you can do so after finishing your run on the game page.
